### [...The Sonic Turn...]
There was a kind of broad turn towards sound in the Academy and also in the visual and sonic arts. 
So, just an image of a bunch of books that came out right around the, kind of, turn of the millenium, by anthropologists, by sociologists, by historians, who try to think of the history of sound, try to situate sound as a kind of marker of cultural and temporal difference. 
Right around the same time, sound art as an entity came to be something that was embraced by curators, maybe a less so by artists, and presented in a bunch of survey exhibitions, again just a quick list of some important survey exhibitions from around the sort of turn of the milenium in Berlin, in London, in New York, in Tokyo, in Paris. 
And again it's in this context that the term sound art came to be, came to really, come into the art world currency though as I mention at the outset there was still a lot of resistence to it. 
Now a lot of things kind of account for this sonic turn, it partly seems to coincide with the rise of the internet, which connected experimental communities all over the world and fostered some kind of awareness of the history that I have been presenting. 
I think the wide spread availability of digital tools enabled translations across media allowed ordinary people to do things that otherwise would require big institutional support. 
I think partly, also, the demise of the record industry right around 1990-2000, with the rise of Napster and other things, made artists try, musicians and artists, look for other venues and ways to present their work. 
But I also think that this kind of sonic turn was fostered by the waning of a longtime paradigm in cultural theory and criticism, and I think art history as well, that favored text and image, and in general focused on a notion of representation that both music and sound more broadly, really didn't have much of a, kind of, resonance with. 
So, I'm gonna now quickly move to a bunch of different practices, just to give you a broad survey of some of the things that today go under this term.
Paradoxically as it may seem, not all sound art makes sound, indeed a number of importat projects by sound artists explore sound through silent images and objects. 
Fascinating by the cultural recording, both photographic and phonographic, Christian Marclay, often examines the connections and disjunctions between sound and image. 
So this piece, for example, from 1988 called Chorus II, presents found photographs of open mouths in song or in speech or in something. 
The gap at the center of each image drawing attention to the fundemental lack that is the incapacity of the image to supply its sonic content. 
Another project from the same year, The Sound of Silence, is simply a photograph Simon & Garfunkel's 1964 single "The sound of silence". 
So, Marclay exploits the record's paradoxical title to offer a reflection of the differences between photography and phonography, and the dysjunctions between image, text, object and sound. 
As a visual phenomenon, the photograph, the record object, and its text, all refer to a sound that they capture in various ways, but can't then redeliver. 
Yet, by the same token these muted media adiquately capture the silence that the song itself precludes. 
Later projects by Marclay investigate this, kind of, indeterminancy of translation between sound and image. 
And in particular the generative capacities of the musical score, which even in its conventional form requires the performer to render a set of visual symbols as sounds. 
So this piece, is a piece called Graffiti Composition, it was done for a sound art festival in 1996 in Berlin and Marclay just posted a bunch of blank staff paper, music paper, around Berlin and left it there for a few weeks, and then went back and photographed the remains, and then printed these on cards, that are about this big, that were then used for, by improvising musicians to improvise; right, then so these became a kind of musical score, but a very much kind of mix and match musical score. 
I've seen people just to six cards	laid out. I've seen people try to do the whole deck, which is something like, I don΄t know, 40-50 images, or something like that. 
These translations between sound and image are central to the work of Steve Roden, an audiovisual artist in Los Angeles, whose work is rooted in sound, he is a painter as well as a sound artist. 
In the late 1990's Roden began to divise these idiosyncratic translation schemes in order to spark new ideas in chance conjunctions. 
So this set of sculptures, this is close-up, called Letter Forms, they're just simply a set of wood and thread sculptures that model the sound waves of the artist's voice speaking or singing each letter of the alphabet. 
The vowl sounds painted in accordance with letter-colour associations laid out in Arthur Rimbaud's poem Alchemy of the Verb, which is a poem that is often used by people interested in sort of synaesthisia and this sort of, cross translations among the senses.
The work of Jennie C. Jones, is a contemporary painter, these, it's hard to photograph her work. 
In about 2011 she started to make what she called acoustic paintings. So these paintings toward the history of minimalist painting, think of folks like Barnett Numan, Ellsworth Kelly and Ryan Hart, M.S. Martin, were first to that tradition, but the materials and the  titles infuse this work with other kinds of references. 
Particularly, references to the jazz composers and improvisers that in the 1950's and 1960's formed a parallel avant garde with the abstract expressionists and minimalist painters, but it's and avant garde that is treated very differently, that's often relegated to the domain of music or popular music. 
Whereas Jones wants to sort of rescue this a kind of african american experimental artistic practice. 
And so, most of her paintings, I'll just show you a few. This central pannel, is all, this is an accoustic panel, so it's the kind of panelling you use, like this, right, to dampen sound. 
So she thinks of her work as registering sound, but also, as having an impact on the sound in the space. 
And often the paintings, she'll often have, sometimes in the space itself, sometimes in a seperate listening room, sound works that work with often recordings of classic jazz vocalists and pianists. 
She'll often zoom in on a particular passage and she'll sort of destend it, layer it, so they become, a kind of parallel to this. 
She doens't think of them as a sound track, she thinks of these as kind of seperate works. This is a piece dedicated to Teddy Wilson, great swing pianist, this is for Elvin Jones, key part of Coltrane Quartet. 
Another artist who works with image in this way is Christine Sun Kim, who's a deaf artist...
